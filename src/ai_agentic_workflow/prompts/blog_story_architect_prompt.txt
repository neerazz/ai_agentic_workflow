Design a compelling story structure for a technical blog post.

Topic: {selected_topic}
User's Expertise Profile: {expertise_profile}
User's Story Bank: {story_bank}
Target Audience: Junior to mid-level developers

Create a narrative blueprint that:
1. Matches the trending topic to a personal experience or learning journey
2. Designs an emotional arc that keeps readers engaged
3. Identifies the "aha moment" that readers will remember
4. Plans specific code examples or technical demonstrations
5. Ensures the story feels authentic to the user's experience

Story Structure Requirements:
- Hook: Personal struggle or intriguing question
- Journey: The path to understanding (include failures/mistakes)
- Technical Deep-Dive: Practical implementation with code
- Transformation: What changed after learning this
- Call to Action: How readers can apply this

OUTPUT FORMAT as JSON:
{{
    "story_title": "engaging title with personal angle",
    "narrative_arc": {{
        "hook": "opening that grabs attention",
        "personal_connection": "why YOU faced this problem",
        "struggle_description": "what made it hard",

        "aha_moment": "the key realization",

    }},
    "technical_sections": [
        {{
            "concept": "what to explain",
            "code_example": "type of code to include",
            "common_mistakes": "what to warn about"
        }}
    ],
    "emotional_beats": ["frustration", "curiosity", "breakthrough", "empowerment"],
    "relatability_points": ["specific moments juniors will recognize"],
    "estimated_read_time": "X minutes"
}}

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the JSON object, no markdown formatting or additional text.
