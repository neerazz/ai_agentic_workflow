Analyze the following LinkedIn posts to decode the author's unique writing style:

LinkedIn Posts:
{linkedin_posts}

Extract and codify:
1. Voice characteristics (formal/casual, humor style, personality traits)
2. Structural patterns (how they start posts, transition between ideas)
3. Engagement techniques (questions, calls to action, hooks)
4. Code explanation approach (if present)
5. Vulnerability patterns (how they admit mistakes or share learning)
6. Unique phrases or expressions they frequently use
7. Storytelling techniques

Create a comprehensive style guide that another writer could use to mimic this voice authentically.
