Sure! Hereâ€™s a structured breakdown of actionable tasks required to fulfill the CIO's request for a comprehensive report
on the Year-to-Date (YTD) Internal Rate of Return (IRR) for the investment portfolio:

1. **Retrieve Portfolio Data:**
    - Gather asset-level data including cash flows (both gross and net) for all portfolio assets since the beginning of
      the year (YTD).

2. **Calculate YTD IRR:**
    - Compute the Year-to-Date (YTD) IRR for each asset based on the collected cash flows and the current Net Asset
      Value (NAV).

3. **Classify Assets by Asset Class:**
    - Categorize all assets into defined Asset Classes (e.g., Equities, Fixed Income, Real Estate, Private Equity,
      Credit).

4. **Classify Assets by Geographic Region:**
    - Categorize all assets into defined geographic regions (e.g., North America, Europe, Asia, Latin America, etc.).

5. **Aggregate YTD IRR by Asset Class:**
    - Calculate the average YTD IRR for each Asset Class, summarizing the data in a table format.

6. **Aggregate YTD IRR by Region:**
    - Calculate the average YTD IRR for each Geographic Region, summarizing the data in a table format.

7. **Compare Against Benchmarks:**
    - Identify and select relevant benchmarks for comparison (e.g., MSCI indices, Bloomberg Barclays indices, etc.) for
      each Asset Class.

8. **Gather LTM Performance Data:**
    - Collect the Last Twelve Months (LTM) IRR data for each asset for comparative analysis against the YTD results.

9. **Analyze Performance Trends:**
    - Evaluate performance trends by comparing the YTD IRR with the LTM IRR to identify patterns, improvements, or
      declines in performance.

10. **Compile Reporting Currency Details:**
    - Confirm the reporting currency for this analysis (e.g., USD, EUR, etc.) and ensure all calculations are consistent
      with this currency.

11. **Prepare Summary Insights:**
    - Draft concise insights and commentary on the performance results, highlighting significant findings or trends
      observed in the data.

12. **Format Results for Presentation:**
    - Organize the calculated data into a clear, concise summary format and prepare it for presentation, ensuring that
      all tables are structured for easy understanding.

Following these tasks will yield a thorough analysis that meets the CIO's request while providing valuable insights and
benchmarks for decision-making.
